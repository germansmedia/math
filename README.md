# math

All the math you ever wanted.

## Design Philosophy

- Bundle together coordinates for various purposes as much as possible.
- Use the same notation for everything.
- Overload operators, so it looks readable.
- Direct access to coordinate members.
- Lowercase extension to basic types, like f32v2, f32m4x4, etc.

## Elements

### Vectors

u16xy, isizexyz, f32xyzw, etc.

### Matrices

f32m2x2, f64m4x4, etc.
(maybe also 2x3, 2x4, etc. and maybe also generic nxm)

### Multivectors

f32mv2, f64mv4, etc.

### Rectangles

u32r, f64r, etc.

### Volume

f32v, f64v, etc.

### Complex Numbers

f32c, f64c, etc.

### Quaternions

f32q, f64q, etc.

### Euler Angles

f32ypb, f64ypb, etc.

### Color Specifications

f32rgb, f64rgba, etc.
